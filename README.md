### My workflow:

For this project i used githubs kanban to manage issues, tasks, etc. Here is the project [kanban](https://github.com/Elir-Mahad/weather-app/projects/1) 

I divided my time in the following order: 

1. Research on what the project entails and what tools i will need.

2. Write out issues and tasks based on what i assume the project entails.
  - The research was continous so i refined my issues and tasks whenever it seemed necessary. 

3. Coding out the project. You will notice that each task was upon completiton committed.
